# Advent of Code

My solutions for "Advent of Code", at least as far as I've gotten:

https://adventofcode.com

## So far...
- 2023: Go Go Gophers!
- 2024: Planned to do Rust, but didn't really get to it all, so redoing it in
  2025 in Odin (previously Zig, but I'm enjoying Odin more at the moment)
- 2025: Rust, hopefully ;)
- 2026: Maybe Zig, if it's out of beta 😁


I reserve the right to skip days or parts of days with puzzles I don't enjoy (e.g. most matrix / grid puzzles where it's less about solving an interesting problem and more about wrangling array indices) 😎
