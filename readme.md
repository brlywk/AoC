# Advent of Code

My solutions for "Advent of Code", at least as far as I got:

https://adventofcode.com

## So far...
- 2023: Go Go Gophers!
- 2024: Planned to do Rust, but didn't get to it all really, so redoing it in
  2025 in Odin (previously Zig, but that just isn't as much fun as Odin to me)
- 2025: Rust, hopefully ;)
